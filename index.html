        <p>
            O, to take what we love inside,
            to carry within us an orchard, to eat
            not only the skin, but the shade,
            not only the sugar, but the days, to hold
            the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite into   
            the round jubilance of peach.
            
            There are days we live
            as if death were nowhere
            in the background; from joy
            to joy to joy, from wing to wing,
            from blossom to blossom to
            impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom.</p>

            <p>
            This website was inspired by the poem “From Blossoms” by Li-Young Lee. I heard this poem read aloud in a writing class and it really moved me. The final lines of the poem have stuck with me since. I made my website based off how I read the last lines—“from blossom to blossom to impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom”— It's like letting out a breath.</p>
