            From Blossoms

        <p>
            O, to take what we love inside,
            to carry within us an orchard, to eat
            not only the skin, but the shade,
            not only the sugar, but the days, to hold
            the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite into   
            the round jubilance of peach.
            
            There are days we live
            as if death were nowhere
            in the background; from joy
            to joy to joy, from wing to wing,
            from blossom to blossom to
            impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom.</p>

            <p>
                I first heard the poem “From Blossoms” in  a creative writing class when the professor read it aloud. The professor had previously told us that poetry conveys what other literature styles can’t, and I didn’t understand. Then he read this poem aloud and the last three beats left me a little misty-eyed… totally caught me by surprise. My website is inspired by the build up of rhythm those three beats create. </p>            </div>
